            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Aiman Daniel. I am a self-taught web developer based in Sungai Buloh, Selangor. I
                started coding when I was around 13 years old. I am now 18 years old and trying to make some money
                before college. I am willing to learn anything as long as I have the proper guides and working
                environment. You can contact me at aiman2301 [at] gmail [dot] com.
            </p>

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the first language that I learnt in my journey to become a web developer.

                <div class="box" id="skill_css">
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I learned Bootstrap CSS but now I am relearning the fundamentals of CSS.

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although JavaScript is one of the essentials in web development, this language is quite new to
                        me as I did not know the proper development workflow back then. I started learning JavaScript
                        <em>properly</em> at the end of 2018.

                    <h3>PHP</h3>
                    <p>
                        PHP is one of my favourite languages. I know a lot about PHP, from the beginner to the advanced
                        stuff like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I have used frameworks such as CodeIgniter and
                        Laravel in my work. I also know how to use Composer.

                <div class="box" id="skill_mysql">
                    <h3>MySQL</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the first and only SQL Database that I have learnt. I use MySQL with PHP and it is my
                        database of choice most of the time because a lot of references and guides can be found on the
                        Internet.

                    <h3>Git</h3>
                    <p>
                        I know the basics of Git such as clone, pull, commit and push and I have used it in my previous job.

                    <h3>Linux</h3>
                    <p>I know the basic linux commands. I am currently running Lubuntu 18.10 on my laptop.</p>
